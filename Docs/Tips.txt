# TIPS For Using ROS Noetic / Ubuntu 20.04 With "Hands On ROS For Robotics Programming"

This image is based on Ubuntu 20.04 which includes Python3,  
now that python (python2.x) is obsoleted.

This image uses ROS Noetic which is the latest and last ROS that will be released.

1) ROS Noetic Desktop is already installed  (ros-noetic-desktop)  
   You do not need to do the ROS install steps in Chapter 3 pgs 85-87  

2) Wherever the book mentions melodic, substitute noetic:   
   e.g. change:  sudo apt install ros-melodic-navigation  
   to:  sudo apt install ros-noetic-navigation  
  
3) Wherever the book's code has python, change to python3  
   e.g.  change: #!/usr/bin/env python  
   to:   #!/usr/bin/env python3  
  
4) Wherever the book's code uses a print statement without parens,  
   e.g.  change:  print msg  
   to:   print(msg)
